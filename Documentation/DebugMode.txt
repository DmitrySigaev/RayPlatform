The debug mode if RayPlatform can be enabled by calling
ComputeCore::enableProfiler().

For instance, Ray is a software that uses RayPlatform and its option
-debug does just that.

Furthermore, the RayPlatform debug mode can be activated in the middle
of a computation by sending SIGUSR1 to processes that should activate
debug mode. Sending SIGUSR1 again will disable the debug mode. Basically,
Sending SIGUSR1 toggles the debug mode.

In the future, sending SIGUSR1 to the RayPlatform core will cause it
to read (or attempt to) a command file named Commands.txt in the
current directory (PWD).
